You as a developer have the flexibility to define the user workflow and control the options available to users. You can choose from a guided exploration of the analysis through authored fixed dashboards, to a free-form analytic exploration environment in which users choose their own visualizations – and virtually anything in between.

Complete these four steps to add {{site.data.keyword.dynamdashbemb_short}} into an application:
1. Creating an {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} account and provisioning a {{site.data.keyword.dynamdashbemb_short}} service instance.
2. Creating a service credential to access the service instance API.
3. Creating a {{site.data.keyword.dynamdashbemb_short}} session from your web service application.
4. Adding {{site.data.keyword.dynamdashbemb_short}} into your web client application through the {{site.data.keyword.dynamdashbemb_short}} JavaScript API.
5. {{site.data.keyword.dynamdashbemb_short}} uses the powerful IBM Cognos Analytics dashboard experience.
